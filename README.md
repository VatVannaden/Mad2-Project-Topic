## 1 Introduction
**JobLink** is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers within Cambodian communities.  
It provides a centralized, trustworthy, and accessible platform for discovering, posting, and applying to job opportunities.

## 2 Problem Statement
Employment challenges remain critical in Cambodia, particularly for young graduates. Despite the availability of opportunities, the current job-seeking process faces several limitations:

- **Information Gaps:** Employers struggle to reach qualified candidates, while job seekers lack reliable sources.  
- **High Intermediary Costs:** Recruitment agencies or middlemen charge high fees, reducing accessibility.  
- **Limited Accessibility:** Many postings remain scattered across Facebook groups and informal channels.  
- **Unverified Postings:** Job scams and misleading ads discourage job seekers.  
- **Digital Divide:** Small businesses often lack affordable recruitment tools to advertise jobs effectively.  

These barriers contribute to unemployment, underemployment, and lost opportunities for economic growth.
